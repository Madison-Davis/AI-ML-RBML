# Part 1: Eclat Algorithm on Apparel Trend Prediction
Project intended to see how the Eclat algorithm (a type of Association Rule Learning technique) would be effective in predicting shopping apparel trends.  This knowledge is useful for store owners to know so that they can pair items together in future sales in order to incentivize consumption.

# Part 2: Apiori Algorithm on Complementary Goods
Example of the Apiori Alogrithm (a type of Association Rule Learning technique) to determine what grocery store items are most frequently bought together. Applications can include: consumer discounts for buying similar items and placing similar-purchased items together in stores. Both would be done in order to incentivize more purchases.
